/**
 * A simulation is anything which evolves over time with a series of time steps.
 * 
 * Implement Simulation to class.
 * 
 *Execute the simulation in a background thread via the SimulationManager.  This allows it to evolve in 
 *a controlled or real time way, but to get regular snapshots for display.
